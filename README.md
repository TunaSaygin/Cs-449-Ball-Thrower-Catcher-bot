# Cs 449-Ball Thrower Catcher bot

- I first tried to grasp the ball and take the ball to way0 (which may be used as an initial position for the throwing action)
- However, the start-area and the bin is acting like they are connected to the ball in the simulation.
- I couldn't understand why is it happening like that, so it needs to be solved. 
- Also, I chenged the prefic from t_ to l_ because the "gripperCloseGrasp" function was giving an error of nonexisting gripper.
- Then I added an algorithm to calculate the velocity and the angle for the throwing action but I couldn't test it. 
- so it needs to be tested.
